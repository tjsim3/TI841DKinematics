__Files__
Kinematics.py - Original coded version of the code. Works best, but only runs on computer
TI-84Kinematics.py - Original TI-84 compatible version. File size may be too big for some calculators
TI-84KinematicsShortened.py - Best version to upload to calculator. I use this one on my TI-84 + CE Python Edition
NonPythonKinematics.txt - Use this code if your calculator is not python edition.
